DESCRIPTION:Get up-to-speed on core Java Standard Edition topics in one co
 de-walkthrough-intensive day with Oracle® Java® Champion Paul Deitel.\n\
 n\n- Java® Full Throttle with Paul Deitel is a one-day Safari Live online

 ting object-oriented programming knowledge so you can dive into Java’s r
 obust ecosystem.\n- You’ll review a large number of complete\, working p
 rograms demonstrating key Java capabilities in context\, and you’ll down
 load the code.\n- You’ll create a JavaFX GUI using FXML and JavaFX Scene
  Builder.\n- You’ll see how you can use lambdas\, streams and functional
  interfaces to write programs faster\, simpler\, more concisely and with f
 ewer errors than with previous techniques.\n- You’ll get an introduction
  to some of Java’s concurrent programming capabilities.\n\n\n\nGo to the
